    "description": "Generic programmes and qualifications are those providing fundamental and personal skills education which cover a broad range of subjects and do not emphasise or specialise in a particular broad or narrow field. This broad field should not be used as a residual category. Programmes and qualifications with a specific subject emphasis should be classified in broad fields 01 to 10. In particular, education at the tertiary level should only by way of exception be classified here.",
